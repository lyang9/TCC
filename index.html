                    <p class="text-muted">As a graduating student I had an inner debate before going on this trip, as
                     mid-March was supposed to be a crucial time for my graduation thesis work and job searching. "Will I
                     fall behind the progress or lose job opportunities? Can I have peace on this week-long trip?" I eventually
                     decided that I should first give time to Him because it isn't mine in the first place. I visited the
                     Navajo Nation with a heart determining to connect with and learn form the native people as well as
                     Pastor Lee and his wife, who was serving as missionaries. Pastor Lee's story truly inspired me to have
                     faith in following God's leading in my life. "I am the vine; you are the branches. If a man remains in
                     me and I in him, he will bear much fruit; apart from me you can do nothing." (John 5"15)</p>

                    </div>
                    <p class="text-muted">As a newborn Christian that time, I decided to join the mission trip to do morefor
                    God and experience Him more even though I didn't know what's exactly mission trip is at that time. The
                    Navajo mission trip lets me deeply feel how powerful God is. We visited the Great Canyon and so many different
                    beautiful national parks, the high mountain tops and the deep canyons that were all created by God's hand. I
                    was excited to know more about God and meet other brothers and sisters in Christ on the other side of the nation
                    and hopefully hear some of their sharing. I am so thankful to see other people believing the same beliefs as we
                    do. At the church in Navajo Nation, as they sing the praise songs in their own language, even though I could not
                    understand the meaning, but I can feel the faith and happiness throughout their voice the way they praise our
                    Lord Jesus. My whole body was shaking when I heard them sing. God is everywhere caring different kinds of people
                    through out the world. After the trip, all I want to say is, I have more faith in God, I want to do more for Him.
                    And it's so amazing that I never thought I could make it to this trip because of the money issue. I have prayed for it
                    alone and with friends. And ask for Him if you think you want me to go to this mission, please make it happen.
                    Have faith in God, He will take care of the rest. He has a great plan for all of us, just the matter of time.</p>

                    <p class="text-muted">In my mind, my parents have always been overprotective. So before going on to
                    mission trip, I have to go through the "mission impossible" first, which is an approval from my mom.
                    When I asked her with my 0.00...01% of hope and 100% of fear. Somehow she agreed!! It then became my
                    first mission trip and my first trip without the company of my parents. Sometimes, you just have to
                    ask God an leave the rest of the work to Him. "God can do anything, you know - far more than you could
                    ever imagine or guess or request in your wildest dreams!" (Ephesians 3:20-21) With everything prepared
                    we arrived Navajo and met up with Pastor Lee and his wife. Pastor Lee taught us about Navajo's culture
                    and that they are very sensitive to what we do/say With my mixed feelings of excitement and nervousness,
                    we arrived at the New Testament Indian Gospel Church. Everything went out great! Everyone was extremely
                    friendly! Aside from the difference of race, culture, and language we are just the same. I can deeply
                    feel the welcome and love from them. We may be strangers but under GOD we are all brothers and sisters.</p
